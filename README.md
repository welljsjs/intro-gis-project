# Intro to GIS - Uni Project

This project uses `renv` for R dependency management. All packages will be installed, if necessary, by the project itself. No preinstallation is needed.

The **report** can also be found as a **PDF document** named [report.pdf](./report.pdf).

## How to run

1. Open project.Rproj in RStudio. 
2. If not opened already, open "report.Rmd". 
3. Click "Run All" (sequentially) in RStudio and wait. The report will be (re-)generated.

All data used can be found in the [data](./data) directory.
